# Building the clone of the Groww Website.

Hello there, you might have seen the Groww Website, where investors can trade and invest in Stocks and Mutual funds..

Moving ahead, we team 19 at Masai School developed a clone of the website of Groww within a week as a part of our curriculum.

This blog is all about our journey and the challenges we faced while building the project.

# What was our problem statement and how did I approach it:-

So we had a problem statement that we have to create a clone of a website called groww.com . Also, We can only use my HTML, CSS, and core JavaScript knowledge. We were three members in our group.

# Some Snapshots of our project that we made:-

 # How We divided the work in our Team members:-
 
 As we were three members in our team so it was very important to decide how we will approach the work so that
 
 in the future we should not face any problem in merging the code, as well as the tasks, get divided into equal 
 
 parts.So, on the first day, As a team leader, I made a git repository and everyone was told to make their separate 
 
 git branch by cloning the repo and push their work there and when they feel that they have completed it.They can show
 
 it to one of the members(team leader) and after the approval, they can merge their code to the main branch.I was mainly
 
 responsible for making the Product page and navigation bar and script part which are similar on all the pages.
 
 And my other team members were responsible for the login page, landing page, and Cart page and make the page look better.
 
 # The outcome and important learning from the project:-
 
 This entire journey of making the project was awesome. We learned lots of things by applying to the real website and
 
 it gave us a lot of confidence. Although we could have done more such as we could have added a timer and there were some
 
 more functionalities that could have been done, yeah the time didn't permit us to go further. But we will surely improve it
